This typically happens when someone deceives you, either intentionally (like a wizard creating an illusion to hide their actual tower) or unintentionally (such as when the location you attempt to teleport to no longer exists).\r\n\r\nYour arrival is determined as follows: On Target: You and your targets arrive exactly where you mean to.\r\n\r\nOff Target: You and your targets arrive some distance away from the target in a random direction.
